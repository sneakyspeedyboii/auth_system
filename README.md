# Authentication System

Re-written, Intented to make it as copy-paste for other projects I might use it in, but I don't know if thats the case anymore

Currently implements session based auth through the use of cookies, does time out ip

Stuff to do:

- Captcha
- OAuth2 support
- MFA support
- Still need to make email parsing less horrible
- Use relation or what ever its called for online users
- Maybe refractor and rewrite the authenticate extractor or something idk im not fixing that soon
- Peppering: https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet.html#peppering
